# Congressional_App
This is a video of a US Congressional App Challenge winning project that I worked on. The app's name is "Quick Maths" and its purpose is to provide a fun and engaging way for younger students to practice their arithmetic skills. Users are given a list of several numbers. Upon selecting a number, multiple numbers are randomly generated and user must select the order of operations needed to manipulate the numbers and achieve the selected number.

The app was developed using Android Studios for Java. It utilized 700+ lines of code. My role in the project was developing the algorithm that generates the numbers and checks to see if the order of operations the user inputs achieves the correct specified number.

Special thanks to my friends David Yang, Hayden Kwan, and Alex Hu and their contributions to the project.
